        "Simulation process is designed determine the throughput of trains running between 4 stations (London Euston to Birmingham Cruzon) on HSR line for 60 min. High Speed trains never run in perfect ideal scenario, various extrenal factors impacts the speed and movement of the train in real world scenario. Strong winds heavily impacts overall traveling time of High Speep trains **[4]**, which makes it an imparotant factor to be considered while designing the simulation for High speed trains. In Refernce with Beaufort wind force scale **[5]** values 5-10 is selected. Using the values of this impact factor is calculated, overall which will affect the movement of trains in HSR line. Also, variablity in dwell time is considered which is caused due to fluctuation in movement of passangers. "

Variablity in travel time due to wind and Passanger movement is induced in the simulation. Various combination of blocks and trains is tested to determine the optimal value. Based on observed results of simulation tests, 7 blocks and 12 trains is determined to be the most optimal values for designed simulation and average travel time for train to complete journey resulted to be arround 47 min in ideal scenario with no added variablity."
